What is Google Cloud Platform?

• Google Cloud Platform offers a competitive array of services to meet the needs of on-demand compute, storage and networking infrastructure to act as the delivery platform for your applications.
• Internally, Google uses this infrastructure for several high-traffic and global-scale services, including Gmail, Maps, YouTube, and Search.
Similarities to AWS
• Just like AWS, Google offers a collection of managed and unmanaged services which can be consumed and delivered on-demand.
• Just like AWS, Google Cloud Platform offers elasticity to both scale out and scale in.
• Both Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform offer a shared security responsibility environment.


How do you use it?

Just like AWS there is an entire ecosystem that is associated with Google Cloud Platform services.
• SDK Client libraries with support for multiple languages
• Management tools including web based and Cloud SDK command line interfaces
• Cloud SDK emulators for Google Cloud Pub/Sub and Google Cloud Datastore allow you to simulate services in your environment for local development, testing and validation
• Cloud Shell command-line from any browser, anywhere with an internet connection

Lecture: Service and Feature Comparison
##################################################
Google compute engine is a direct competitor to ec2

both offer:
ondemand access to virtual machine instances
temporal virtual machines
policy driven auto scaling

ec2
additional pricing options for persistent and non-persistent workloads
more instance types
auto scaling can be done manually or scheduled in addition to dynamic scaling based on the value of a metric

GCE
custom machine types variable core counts and memory capacity
instance live migration avoids downtime for infrastructure maintenance events
cloud shell browser based command line access to your instances
sub-hour billing and simple sustained use discount



PaaS
Elastic beanstalk vs google app engine

both:
autoscaling, load balancing and monitoring included
managed platform

Elastic Beanstalk:
behine the scenes if you choose to deploy to docker ECS is leveraged making it a natural transition if more control over the application environment is necessary
SDK is specific to elastic beanstalk

Google App Engine:
Customized CPU and memory for the instances whick run your app engine
flexible environment, uses standard docker containers
custom runtimes are only available in flexible environments
Standard environment users custom built Google containers
SDK is specific to GAE



EC2 container service vs Google container engine

both:
a platform to manage containers
docker support
a variety of supported OS
integrated logging and monitoring

EC2 container service:
AWS ECS agents can only be run exclusively on EC2 instances

Google container engine:
Kubernetes for orchestration
google container engine charges an additional flat fee per hour per clusters for larger than 5 nodes
google container engine instances run wherever kubernetes can run which includes EC2


##################################################
Lecture: Pricing
##################################################
IaaS

EC2 Vs GCE
on demand instance pricing
temporal instance pricing


EC2:
Charged by the hr, rounding up to the nearest hour
reserved instances
  standard
  convertible
  scheduled
dedicated instances
dedicated hosts
pay some, none or all up front for reserved instances


GCE:
Charged per minute minimum
pixed pricing with no restrictions
sustained usage discount
sizing recommendations to reduce costs
no upfront cost commitment
inferred instances


Elastic beanstalk vs google app engine

Both:
Pricing determined by resource usage

Elastic beanstalk:

you pay for AWS resources you create to run your application

google app engine:
a free but limited quota is granted daily
you begin to incur a cost as the free quota is exceeded


EC2 container service vs Google container engine

Both:
pricing determined by resource usage


EC2 container service:
you pay for AWS resources you create to run your application


Google container engine
Google container engine uses google compute engine instances for nodes in the cluster
there is an additional fee for cluster sizes greater than 5 nodes

Lecture: Best Use Cases
##################################################
Know your workload...

• Understanding your workload is key to ensure you get the most out of either Google Cloud Platform or Amazon Web Services

How?
• Collect metrics from CloudWatch
• Examine AWS Config for an inventory
• Review your past billing statements
• Check Trusted Advisor for cost and resource optimization
New project?
• Estimate usage and growth and use pricing calculators
• Understand project requirements



Google Compute Engine Best Use Cases

Do you have fault tolerant or single-point-of-failure workloads?
Instance live migration during Google Compute Engine infrastructure maintenance could prevent an outage.
Do you expect your workload instances to run for at least one year or more? If your project lasts longer than a month, but less than a year it might be less expensive.
Are your workloads typically underutilized? Google Compute Engine offers rightsizing advice.
Do you have a use case for non-overlapping instances with the same configuration? You would receive an inferred instance discount.


Google App Engine Best Use Cases

Can you accept some tradeoffs?
App Engine is a mature product but with less mature supporting services, compare to AWS RDS.
Are you willing to accept a mature platform with less customization options?
If you are comfortable with a managed platform service, it may not matter to you. Or, you may choose the flexible environment which is still in beta.
It may be easier to scale your application.
If you can design for App Engine infrastructure you may have an easier time with scaling your application.


Google Container Engine Best Use Cases

Do you already run Kubernetes?
If you already run Kubernetes in your datacenter or on EC2 but don’t want the overhead of managing it.
Are you concerned about vendor lock-in? ECS only runs within Amazon Web Services

Lecture: Best Use Cases
##################################################
AWS
  AWS has more international datacenters than Google.
  AWS has more robust Route53 routing policies, including geo-routing.
Google Cloud Platform
  Google Cloud Platform does not require “pre-warming” of load balancers.   Google Cloud Platform includes direct peering to CDN edge locations.

Best Use Cases
  AWS is more suited for international businesses that require more points-of- presence around the world and appropriate geo-routing policies to take advantage of their global presence.
  Google Cloud Platform is more suited for US-based businesses that require quick scaling, robust caching and simpler pricing.

Comparison of S3 to Google Cloud Storage

Both:
Bucket storage with unique key and associated metadata
Host static web content and media


S3:
Does not support conditional updates
• Ability to set policies to automatically migrate objects across
storage classes
• Destination for notifications:
• Amazon SNS
• Amazon SQS
• AWS Lambda


Google Cloud Storage:
Name of an object does not affect performance or scalability of accessing bucket objects
• Supports conditional updates for PUT and DELETE
• Post notifications to:
• Target URL
• Webhook that handles notification payload


Comparison of EBS to Compute Engine Persistent Disks

Both:
Built-in redundancy, snapshotting, and ease of disk detachment and reattachment


Elastic Block storage:
An EBS volume can be attached to only one EC2 instance at a time
• Attach up to 40 disk volumes to a Linux instance
• Available in only one region by default
• Local disks are called instance store or ephemeral store
• Can either HDD or SSD

Compute engine persistant disks
Persistent disks in read-only mode can be attached to multiple instances simultaneously
• Attach up to 128 disk volumes
• Snapshots are global and can be used in any region without
additional operations or charges
• Local disks are referred to as local SSD
• SSD only and do incur additional expense


Comparison of Glacier & S3 to Cloud Storage Nearline

All 3:
Infrequently accessed cold storage


S3 Standard - Infrequent Access Storage
First-byte latency period of several milliseconds
• Minimum storage 30 days

Glacier:
Fist byte latency period of 4 hours
min storage 90 says

Cloud storage nearline
First-byte latency period of approximately 3 seconds
• Minimum storage 30 days

Comparison of EFS to ZFS/Avere


ZFS/Avere

Used as a bridge to ensure latency and elasticity
• Specific technology to handle storage bursting from on premise environments to GCP
• Provides application access to Google Cloud Storage via NAS protocols (NFS & SMB)
